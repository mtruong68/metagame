			Anecdote:<br><br>
			Animal Crossing Pocket Camp was released November 22nd, 2017- the day before Thanksgiving. I downloaded the app the same day. In Animal Crossing, you become the manager of a camp, and you befriend animals with gifts. Most of the game's appeal is in learning the other animals’ little quirks and growing attached to them. <br><br>

			When I was a young teenager, I played Animal Crossing, and I adored the cute animals and peaceful gameplay. This game doesn’t have the constant action of shooters or the frustration of puzzle games; it’s kind of like<div class="o" id="garden" onclick="location.href='garden.html'"> tending a garden.</div> Peaceful. Warm. When I downloaded the app, I was hoping for the same warmth that I felt when I was younger. <br> <br>

			I couldn’t go home this Thanksgiving, mostly for financial reasons (it’s hard being a first-generation, low-income student at Northwestern). I spent a few hours on Thanksgiving playing this new game, and a few more with my friends. While chatting over dinner, I mentioned this new game. One of my friends made fun of me for wanting to make <div class="o" id="friends" onclick="friend()">fictional friends.</div> <br><br>

			<div id="text1">
				The implication was that my life is pathetic for wanting to find comfort in computer-generated, fictional “friends” when I had the option of flesh and blood human interaction. <br> <br>
