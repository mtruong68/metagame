Hello, 

It is important for you to know that although I coded most of this project by hand,
there were a few very key resources that I used in making this.

-The Future Splash example from paperjs.org
(for the page about the waves-please try interacting with the water)

-The Division Rasterize example
(for the tend your garden-please try interacting with the blue box)

-https://codepen.io/saransh/pen/BKJun (for the page about stars)
-I used the compiled CSS and HTML because I currently have not learned how to use Sass or Haml

The rest of this project was my own work, except for quotes which have been attributed to 
the correct people (specifically, the Emily Dickinson quote). I created the graphics
and text and the code.
